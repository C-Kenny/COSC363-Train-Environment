# COSC363-Train-Environment

## What is it?
Graphics project made with C++/OpenGL/glut/glew

## Can I see a demo without spending 4 hours getting glut setup?
[.webm demo hosted by me](http://carlkenny.com/media/train_c++_demo.webm)



## TODO:
- Extra features
    * Add object collisions for barrier arms
    * Change dance floor to react to user's music

- Refactor
    * Break into logic and view sections
    * Split into multiple files with headers

- Fix bugs:
    * Investigate existing mouse bug where looking up too high creates mouse issues
    * Barrier arm lights don't glow. Only reflect from center light
    * Poor performance on OSX. Runs at a high FPS on Linux however
